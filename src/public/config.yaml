blurb:
  title: Information
  catchLine: I would like to officially invite you to my 30th birthday!
  paragraphs:
    - Since I've been in Australia so long now, I think it's fitting to have a party!
    - As many of you know, I don't plan to get married or have children so this will be the chance you get to join me for a fiesta!
      I'm hoping it'll be a hot summer, so we'll be under the trees and near a pond to keep us cool.  In the case that the desired location is already taken Saturday morning, the party will take place as close to the original location but a new pin will be updated on map on below.
    - Please RSVP asap (not me asap.plants) via the form below so I can organise enough delicious foods and get an idea of who is joining for a lovely afternoon.
      You are more than welcome to bring dogs or any pets (if they are social) and of course friends and family members.
    - This will be a ECO-friendly party where refusing to use single use products comes first and then second is byo and third is biodegradable.
      All food provided should be finger foods. Only some plates and cutlery will be provided.
      Pretty please bring your own drinking vessel. Iâ€™d appreciate no single use plastics or littering.
    - Please check this website closer to the date for any updates or just message me directly if you have any questions.
    - This is a day for all to enjoy, eating delicious food, outdoors with lovely humans and good vibes only. I look forward to celebrating my birthday with you!

      paragraphs:
        - The party will take place at Centennial Park.
        - The exact location can be seen below in Google Maps.
          Click the link below for the pin location to follow on google maps.
        - If you are driving you can park along the roads close to the picnic spot but Centennial
          park has a one way round road around park so do follow google maps so you don't get lost.
        - There are many public transport options, there are regular trams and buses nearby and
          then you walk to the picnic location, again use google maps if you're not familiar with the area.

        - I have a feeling that the hottest 100 might fall on this day and if this is the case the
          countdown will be live streamed and i will stay at the park until the countdown has finished.
        - There will be kick ons in the park until sun down and potentially a warehose rave afterwards for those who are keen.
