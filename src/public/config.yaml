blurb:
  title: Information
  catchLine: I would like to officially invite you to my 30th birthday!
  paragraphs:
    - Since I've been in Australia so long now, I think it's fitting to have a party!
    - As many of you know, I don't plan to get married or have children so this will be the chance you get to join me for a fiesta!
      I'm hoping it'll be a hot summer, so we'll be under the trees and near a pond to keep us cool.  In the case that the desired location is already taken Saturday morning, the party will take place as close to the original location but a new pin will be updated on map on below.
    - Please RSVP asap (not me asap.plants) via the form below so I can organise enough delicious foods and get an idea of who is joining us for a lovely afternoon.
      You are more than welcome to bring dogs or any pets (if they are social) and of course friends and family members.
    - This is a ECO-friendly party, therefore there will be no single use plastics and no littering.
      All food provided should be finger foods and some plates, cutlery, and glasses will be provided.
      Pretty please bring your own drinking vessel so you can stay hydrated.
    - Please check this website closer to the date for any updates or just message me directly if you have any questions :)
    - This is a day for all to enjoy, eating delicious food, outdoors with lovely humans and good vibes only. I look forward to celebrating my birthday with you!
    - PS â€” This may double as a going away party as I may be moving to Columbia if I get accepted for student exchange. So if you're keen to come to Columbia, this may be your chance to see what it's like before I leave! :)

      label: Centennial Parklands
      paragraphs:
        - The party will take place at Centennial Park.
        - The exact location can be seen below in Google Maps.
          Click the link below for the pin location to follow on google maps.
        - If you are driving you can park along the roads close to the picnic spot but Centennial
          park has a one way round road around park so do follow google maps so you don't get lost.
        - There are many public transport options, there are regular trams and buses nearby and
          then you walk to the picnic location, again use google maps if you're not familiar with the area.

      label: 2pm on Saturday, January 21, 2023
      paragraphs:
        - The party will start at 2pm and finish at 5:30pm.
        - This is a chill hang out picnic so feel free to drop by any of the hours as i'll be hanging around until sun down.
        - I might be moving to Columbia if I get accepted for the exchange program through UNSW, so this party may double as a going away party as well!!
        - There will be kick ons in the park until sun down and potentially a warehouse rave afterwards for those who are keen but I have no idea how to find one of these so i'm taking suggestions for what to do later in the evening! Please let me know any late night ideas!
